### This is a Mobile Immplementation of Vibrotactile Telemetry in React

The history and invention of the morse code is traceable to an American artist and inventor around the 1830’s – Samuel F. B. Morse. It is a system of coded combination of signals, numerals and special symbols like the punctuation marks by the arrangement of dots, dashes and spaces. The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of various lengths, visual signals or flashing light. This version was later improved upon by an American scientist and businessman – Alfred Lewis. 
Our VBTTMC will function as a web based application developed for students with special needs (some form of disabilities) to communicate with the teacher within and outside the classroom.
